Parchment for Inform 7
======================

This is the template used for producing custom Parchment sites in [Inform7](http://inform7.com/).

To upgrade your template, download the [zipball](http://github.com/curiousdannii/parchment/zipball/inform7), unzip it onto your computer, and copy the `Parchment` folder to your Inform Templates folder. (On a Mac, this is the `Library/Inform/Templates` folder in your home directory. On Windows, it's `My Documents\Inform\Templates`.)
